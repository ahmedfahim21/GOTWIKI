          Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff 
          and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy
           novels by George R. R. Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show was shot in 
           the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain. It premiered on HBO in
            the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.
            <br><br>
            Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and follows several
             story arcs throughout the course of the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of
              Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting 
              for independence from whoever sits on it. A second focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling 
              dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne. The third follows the 
              Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from beyond Westeros's northern border.

Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, and international fan base. 
Critics have praised the series for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values, although
 its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) has been subject to criticism. The final season
  received significant critical backlash for its reduced length and creative decisions, with many considering it a 
  disappointing conclusion. The series received 59 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most by a drama series, including Outstanding
   Drama Series in 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic
    Presentation, a Peabody Award, and five nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series â€“ Drama. Many
     critics and publications have named the show as one of the best television series of all time.

          <p>Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of the A Song of Ice and Fire book series by George 
            R. R. Martin, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of Essos. The series 
            follows several simultaneous plot lines. The first story arc follows a war of succession among competing
             claimants for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with other noble families fighting for 
             independence from the throne. The second concerns the exiled scion's actions to reclaim the throne; the
              third chronicles the threat of the impending winter, as well as the legendary creatures and fierce peoples
               of the North.</p>
